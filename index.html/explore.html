        In 1996, Google started out as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two Ph.D. students at Stanford University. In 1998, Page and Brin while continuing to perfect their technology bought a terabyte of disks at bargain prices and built their own computer housings in Page’s dorm room, which became Google’s first data center. In 1999, the beta logo came off the Google Web site. Since then Google has expanded its search technology into blogging, mapping, shopping, research and more. In fact, Google now has so many services it’s hard to keep them straight.
