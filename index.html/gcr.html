    <h1>Google classroom</h1>
    <h3>Google Classroom is a free blended learning platform developed by Google for educational institutions that aims to simplify creating, distributing, and grading assignments. The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to streamline the process of sharing files between teachers and students. As of 2021, approximately 150 million users use Google Classroom.
<br>
        Google Classroom uses a variety of proprietary user applications (Google Applications for Education) with the goal of managing student and teacher communication. Students can be invited to join a class through a private code or be imported automatically from a school domain. Each class creates a separate folder in the respective user's Google Drive, where the student can submit work to be graded by a teacher. Teachers can monitor each student's progress by reviewing the revision history of a document, and, after being graded, teachers can return work along with comments and grades.</h3>
        <br>
        Assignments
Assignments are stored and graded on Google's document applications. Rather than sharing documents that reside on the student's Google Drive with the teacher, files are hosted on the student's Drive and then submitted for grading. Teachers on Google Classroom have the option of creating Assignments in various templates and formats with different accessibility options, such as permissions to view, edit, and comment. These assignments can be submitted for a grade and allow the teacher to provide feedback. Students may also attach additional documents from their Drive to their assignment.

Grading
Google Classroom supports different grading schemes. Turned in assignments can be graded by teachers and returned with comments before the final submission, allowing for the students to modify their work. Once turned in, assignments can only be edited by the teacher.
<br>
<h1>Communication</h1>
Announcements can be posted by teachers to a "class stream" which can be commented on by students.Students may also post to the class class stream, although teachers retain a moderator role. Multiple types of media from Google products such as YouTube videos and Google Drive files can be attached to announcements and posts to share content. Gmail also provides email options for teachers to send emails to one or more students in the Google Classroom interface.
<br>
<h1>Originality Report</h1>
Introduced in 2020, Originality Report is a built-in plagiarism detection tool which both students and teachers can access. Teachers can view the originality report, allowing them to verify the academic integrity of the student's submitted work. On the free version of G Suite for Education, teachers can turn on originality report for 3 assignments but have limited cloud storage. This restriction is lifted on the paid version of G Suite Enterprise for Education.

<h1>Archive Courses</h1>
Classroom allows instructors to archive courses at the end of a term or year. When a course is archived, it is removed from the homepage and placed in the Archived Classes area. When a course is archived, teachers and students can view it, but won't be able to make any changes to unless it is restored

<h1>Mobile Applications</h1>
Google Classroom mobile apps, introduced in January 2015, are available for iOS and Android devices.
