        <h3>The new things is a continuouus process it may not end it will continue</h3>
       <h2> The Pixel Buds A-Series will come in Sea, too. Other new hardware colors this year include Coral, Snow, Charcoal, Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel and Rose.
        Then there’s the Google Pixel Tablet, which has an 11-inch display, four built-in speakers and the power of the Tensor G2 chip all in one helpful device.
        The Pixel Tablet isn’t flying solo — it comes with the new Charging Speaker Dock, which keeps the device charged and also turns the tablet into a useful home device that you can use hands-free.
        The Pixel Tablet is the first tablet with Chromecast built in, and it's also the first tablet protected by the Titan M2 security chip.
        The new Pixel Tablet also comes in three colors new to Google devices: Porcelain, Hazel and Rose.</h2>
        <h3>Each departments have its own role in this process</h3>
        <h2>The design team developed a textile that creates a dampened feel for the tablet’s dock.
            Google Meet on the Pixel Tablet uses Tensor’s AI to automatically keep you in the center of the frame and adjust the lighting as you move around.
            You can even add a little fun to your video calls with 360-degree backgrounds, like beaches and futuristic cities, that will adjust with you as you move and change positions.
            Thanks to machine learning technology, Assistant voice typing on Pixel Tablet is almost three times faster than regular typing.
            We introduced a few Google Pixel Tablet accessories, including the Pixel Tablet Case, which works with the Charging Speaker Dock and has a polished metal ring stand so you can view the tablet at different angles. And our Made by Google partners introduced other accessories.
            You can buy the Pixel 7a and pre-order the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold today — and if you pre-order the Pixel Fold now, you’ll get a free Pixel Watch.
            And if you buy the Pixel 7a, you get your choice of Pixel Buds A-Series for free or 50% off Pixel Buds Pro.</h2>
